Follow the steps below to synchronize data between the software `Herde` and VitalControl device:

### Connect VitalControl to PC {#connect-vitalcontrol-to-pc}

1. Connect the VitalControl device to your computer or laptop via the supplied USB cable.

1. Make sure your VitalControl device is turned on.

### Perform data exchange {#perform-data-exchange}

1. Within the software `Herde`, perform a full data exchange. Depending on the configuration of your user interface, you can invoke this exchange via the menu item `Full data exchange` in the main menu (top level item _Technology_), in the sidebar menu or in your customized toolbox (horizontal or vertical).

1. A pop-up opens, listing the stipulated technology couplings in the sidebar to the left. Click on the button labeled `VitalControl` in order to start the data exchange:

1. On first time data exchange a warning appears, indicating that there are no animals registered on the VitalControl device yet. Acknowledge this notice with `Yes`. Data exchange is started then.

1. Data exchange is a two-step process: In the first step <span style="font-size: 140%">➊</span> the animal data are transferred from software `Herde` to the VitalControl. In the second step <span style="font-size: 140%">➋</span>, measurement data collected with the VitalControl are transferred into software `Herde`. The number of imported data sets (animals, calvings, alerts and weights) is listed in the pop-up:

If many animals are registered on the VitalControl device, data exchange may take some time. The progress of the data transfer can be seen on the display of the device.
